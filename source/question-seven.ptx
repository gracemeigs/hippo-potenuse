  <title>Question 7</title>
  <p>
    In the picture, <m> A </m> is in the center of the circle. The measure of 
    the central angle <m> A=20&#176; </m>, the line segment <m> AB=18 ft </m>, 
    and line segment <m> AC=13 ft </m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    a. Find the area of the entire triangle, <m> &#9651;ABC </m>. Round to two 
    decimal places.

  <solution>
    <p>
      <m> K=40.02 ft^2 </m>
    </p>
  </solution>
  <p>
    b. Suppose that the shaded region has area <m> 28.85 ft^2 </m>. Use your answer 
    from part a to find the length of the radius of the circle. Round to the nearest 
    whole foot.
  </p>
  <solution>
    <p>
      The radius is about <m> 8 ft </m>
